## Basics
Drifts are a way to take corners faster than you would normally be able to. The downside is that you lose a lot of speed while drifting. The goal is to find the perfect balance between speed and angle. The more you angle your car, the more speed you lose. The less you angle your car, the more speed you can preserve(most of the time, see advanced). Therefore, smoothness over distance traveled.

**Tips**
* Don't be afraid to start your drift early when approaching tight corners. You'll be surprised how much you can still adjust the angle of your car while drifting.
* Hug the inner side of the corner.

### Speed Drift

Below is an illustration about how much angle you need to hold at different speeds on road. \[[2](../../credits#2-imgur-trackmania-2020-sd-skid-width-imgur-httpsimgurcomgallery3rtxja0-accessed-jun-26-2023)\]

NOTE: The angles in the image above are only a rough estimate and speedslides on road only really start at 420 speed instead of 400.
