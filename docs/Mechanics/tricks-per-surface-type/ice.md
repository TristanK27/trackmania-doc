## [[Ice Slides]]
Gives you a gigantic acceleration boost.
### [[**Basics**]]
Start an ice-slide by rotating the car 90 degrees, then counter steer, all while still holding your throttle. You'll notice immediately when you get it.

##### **Transitioning from ice to another surface**
Your tires will stay slippery for a little bit after exiting an ice surface. It's important to line up your car straight (align with the momentum of the car) exiting the ice. If you enter the next surface while still sliding (under an angle) you'll start to slide on that surface as well. This is not what you want since you'll lose a lot of speed. The speed loss will be more pronounced on surfaces that are less slippery. A visual indicator for when the tires are no longer slippery is when the color of the tires change back to their normal color.

There are however some exceptions.

#### **Intermediate**
You probably noticed that you don't have much control over the exact angle that you're turning at and that starting/exiting an ice-slide can be awkward at times. Well here are some tricks to help you with that..

##### **Entering and exiting an ice-slide**
1. When starting an ice-slide, let go of your throttle while doing the rotation movement. This will make the car rotate faster at the cost of a little bit of speed. This trade-off is worth it most of the time because you can start the ice-slide sooner.
2. When exiting an ice-slide, do the same as in 1. This makes you to come out of an ice-slide quicker and allows you to straignten out your car faster.

##### **Adjusting your angle**
It's better to take a turn slightly too wide than to take it to tight. It's easier and faster to adjust to the inside compared to making your turn wider.
1. Brake while still holding throttle. When the brake button is pressed the car will rotate more inwards resulting in a tighter turn.
   1. Brake-tap: Most of the time what you'll want to do is tap brake multiple times to adjust your angle.
   2. Hold brake: Only hold brake for large corrections or for the tightest of turns. Try to not slow down so much that you start gearing down, this will make you lose control of the car if you're not careful.

1. Brake without holding throttle

2. Let go of throttle briefly then press throttle again. This will result in a wider turn since your car will exit the ice-slide temporarily and just slide instead.
   1. Just like with brake-taps it's best to release very briefly but multiple times to adjust your angle. Don't release throttle for too long or you'll risk sliding out.

**For controller**: I recommend that you bind brake to something else than a trigger. This will allow you to press the button extremely shortly. Personnaly I use the x button (playstation) for this.

### Bobsleigh
#### **Basics**
Approach the turns in a way so that the car transitions smoothly to between the red lines. **The smoother the better.**
When you're just starting out on this surface try to not focus on getting between the red lines as quickly as possible, try to do it as smoothly as possible. The control to get between the red lines faster comes later.

#### **Advanced**
1. When you're already driving between the lines rotate your wheels 84%. It is considered cheating to make a custom key that steers at exactly that angle so the next best thing is action key 4 (80%) or trying to hold 84% with an analog device.
2. You can technically do ice wiggles in bobsleigh turns. Incredibly inconsistent, very high risk of slowdown or even completely spinning out. Don't do it, reserved for extremely pro players who want to set a one-time record and the clinically insane.

### Ice Wiggles
Gives your car extra speed compared to driving straight on a straight section of ice.

#### **Basics**
Don't make this your priority, train the other stuff.

Since the [last update](https://www.trackmania.com/news/7126). Ice wiggles are more difficult to pull off,speed gain is minor and on top of that, it gives you a major speed penalty if you miss the ideal timing.
* < 200 speed: Drive straight
* \> 200 speed: Wiggle, but don't if you can't do it consistently. The speed gain is minor and not worth the risk if you can't do is consistently.
