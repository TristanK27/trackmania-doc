Sliding/drifting at a specific angle to accelerate faster compared to driving with full grip.
TODO: Add reference to maps that are good for practicing speeddrifts. map name: tms speed drift
TODO: Explain road at sub 200 speed. As of now I only know that it's really hard to hold a specific angle below 200 speed on road.
Before we begin I would like to point out that it's really easy to get a speeddrift wrong, especially in the beginning. If you only slightly missperform a speeddrift you will lose speed instead of gain it. 

It'll take some time to get used to it, but once you do, you'll be able to accelerate faster than you ever thought possible. Good luck!
## Basics
As the name of the trick implies, you need speed to perform a speeddrift. The exact angles you need to Speed Slide at depends on how fast you're going and differs from surface to surface. The general rule is that the higher your speed, the less angle you need to hold. The lower your speed, the more angle you need to hold.


Training speedslides is best done on FS(fullspeed) maps or maps especially designed for training. [TODO: add link to fullspeed map with assist blocks]. You'll notice that well designed beginner fullspeed maps often have pieces of grass, dirt or plastic at the end of a corner, wall-ride,.... These small strips are there to help you initiate a SpeedDrift. Steer in the direction of the corner while driving over such a strip and you'll notice that your car will start sliding and that skidmarks now appear begind your car. Be gentle with your steering inputs.

Try to get a feel for how much angle you need to hold at different speeds. Once you get the hang of it, you can start practicing on other surfaces.

Below you can find links to the guides that explain how to perform a speeddrift on different surfaces.
