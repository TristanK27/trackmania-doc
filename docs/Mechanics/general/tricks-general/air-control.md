# Airtime
## Airtime
More time on the ground = more time accelerating. Reduce airtime where possible. 
Generally it's adviced hold throttle while in the air since this makes you move the fastest through the air.

**How to reduce airtime**:
1. Slow down right before the jump. (fastest)
2. Let go of the throttle while already in the air. This will slow you down and make you touch the ground sooner.
3. Hold brake while in the air. This slows you down even more but also gets you to the ground even quicker.

There is no 1 trick fits all when it comes to airtime, sometimes it's faster to only do option 2 followed by 3 to gain some extra control. Sometimes you'll just have to use 2. It all depense on the speed you have, how steep the jump is, what your landing environment looks like. I'll try to include some examples of different scenarios.

### Airbraking
There are 2 types of airbraking:

1. Holding brake (like described above)
2. Tapping brake (a ***brake-tap***)

Both will stop your car from rotating in the air (in every axis) but only a brake-tap allows you to do this without losing a noticeable amount of speed.
The shorter the brake-tap to more speed you preserve.

You'll want to stop your rotation in the air to line your car up with the surface that you're landing on. The more parallel to the ground you can land, the more stable your landing will be. 
Sometimes you'll want your car in a specific angle to make your tires touch the ground just a tat sooner but this is a bit more risky to do and not always required.

### Counter Steer
Stops your car from rotating in the air.
Steer in the oposite direction that the car is rotating in.
The happens more gradually compared to air-braking.
